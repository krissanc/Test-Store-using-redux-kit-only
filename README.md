This was fun to do and to explore - the redux kit. The main takeaway is that, while the redux kit is fun to use, it comes with limitations, such as not being able to subscribe to a particular property of the store object, or passing down the store to other components, because it has to be exported, which is fine in this project, but the react-redux kit, as well as the reduxjs/toolkit, offers a lot more versatility that I want to explore next.
